#
# Every ```sh block of the guide is extracted in order and run in ONE bash shell
# with `set -euo pipefail`, exactly as a customer would paste them, so a command
# that fails or a check that does not hold stops the run. Nothing in a block is
# rewritten or skipped. What this script provides is only what the guide's
# "What you need" asks the reader to bring:
#
#   - the cluster: kind, 1 control-plane + 2 workers, Calico as the network
#     plugin (up.sh Phase 1), reached through a kubeconfig holding only it;
#   - the release: every first-party image built from the working tree, tagged
#     ghcr.io/gaboracnicolai/<name>:$EDGE_VERSION and loaded onto the nodes, and
#     the guide's `git clone --branch v$EDGE_VERSION https://github.com/…` served
#     from a local copy of HEAD tagged v$EDGE_VERSION (git url.insteadOf), so it
#     clones the commit under test. Local runs test the COMMITTED HEAD: commit
#     before you run it;
#   - the four variables: PROFILE (ha — deploy/profiles/ha), EDGE_VERSION,
#     NODE_CIDR (kind's docker network) and GATEWAY (127.0.0.1 — the worker
#     kind-config.yaml publishes :80 from).
#
# Then the ha profile is checked to be what runs: every service at the copies the
# profile gives it, each copy Ready, spread over both workers with no node
# holding more than one copy more than the other.
#
# docs/upgrade.md then runs the same way, from the directory the guide installed
# from, to a second release NEW_VERSION: the same images under a second tag and a
# second git tag, so its commands must roll every first-party image to that tag.
# The ha check runs again after it.
#
# Then the cluster is deleted, whether the run passed or failed.
